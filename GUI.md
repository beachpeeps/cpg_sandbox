# Git Training with GitHub Desktop

This guide covers the same Git workflows as the main README.md, but using the **GitHub Desktop** graphical user interface instead of command line. GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly way to manage Git repositories without needing to memorize commands.

3. **Changes Tab**: Shows files you've modified, added, or deleted
4. **History Tab**: Shows commit history for the current branch
5. **Commit Message Box**: Where you write commit messages
6. **Commit Button**: To commit your changes
7. **Push/Pull Buttons**: To sync with GitHub

*Screenshot needed: Main GitHub Desktop interface with labels*

### Navigation Tabs

- **Changes**: View and stage files for commit
- **History**: Browse commit history and see what changed
- **Repository Settings**: Configure repository options

## Checking Your Current Branch

### Visual Indicators

1. **Branch Name**: Look at the top center of the interface - the current branch name is displayed
2. **Branch Dropdown**: Click the branch name to see all available branches
3. **Status Bar**: The bottom of the interface shows current branch and sync status

*Screenshot needed: Branch selector showing current branch highlighted*

### Branch Information

- Current branch is always visible in the top center
- Green checkmark indicates the branch is up to date with remote
- Yellow dot indicates there are unpushed commits
- Red dot indicates there are conflicts or issues

## Understanding Branches (GUI Context)

### What You'll See in GitHub Desktop

- **Branch List**: All branches are visible in the branch dropdown
- **Branch Visualization**: The History tab shows how branches diverge and merge
- **Branch Status**: Visual indicators show which branches are ahead/behind

### Branch Types in the Interface

1. **Local Branches**: Branches that exist only on your computer
2. **Remote Branches**: Branches that exist on GitHub (shown with "origin/" prefix)
3. **Current Branch**: Highlighted in the branch selector

*Screenshot needed: Branch dropdown showing local and remote branches*

## Creating a New Branch

### Method 1: Using the Branch Menu

1. Click on the current branch name in the top center
2. Click **"New branch"** at the bottom of the dropdown
3. Enter a descriptive branch name (see naming conventions below)
4. Choose which branch to base it on (usually `main`)
5. Click **"Create branch"**

### Method 2: Using the Menu Bar

1. Go to **Branch** → **New branch**
2. Enter your branch name
3. Select the base branch
4. Click **"Create branch"**

### Branch Naming Conventions (Same as CLI)

Use the same naming patterns as the command line version:

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/implement-search-functionality

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/fix-login-error
bugfix/resolve-memory-leak

# Other patterns
chore/update-dependencies
docs/add-api-documentation
```

*Screenshot needed: New branch dialog with naming example*

## Making Code Changes

### Creating Files

You can create files in two ways:

#### Method 1: Using Your Code Editor
1. Open your preferred code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
2. Navigate to your repository folder
3. Create new files as needed

#### Method 2: Using File Explorer
1. Open your file explorer
2. Navigate to your repository folder
3. Right-click and create new files

### Example Files to Create

Create the same example files as in the CLI version:

**hello_world.py**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
A simple hello world script for Git training.
"""

def main():
    print("Hello, Git World!")
    print("This is a training exercise.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**calculator.js**:
```javascript
// Simple calculator for Git training
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed");
    }
    return a / b;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Calculator functions loaded!");
console.log("2 + 3 =", add(2, 3));
console.log("10 - 4 =", subtract(10, 4));
```

## Committing Changes

## Comparison: CLI vs GitHub Desktop

| Task | Command Line | GitHub Desktop |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Clone repository | `git clone <url>` | Clone button in interface |
| Create branch | `git checkout -b <name>` | Branch → New branch |
| Check status | `git status` | Changes tab |
| Stage files | `git add <file>` | Checkboxes in Changes tab |
| Commit | `git commit -m "message"` | Commit message + Commit button |
| Push | `git push origin <branch>` | Push origin button |
| Pull | `git pull origin main` | Pull origin button |
| View history | `git log` | History tab |

Both methods achieve the same results - choose the one that feels most comfortable for your workflow!
