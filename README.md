## Setting Up the Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpg_sandbox.git
cd cpg_sandbox
```

### 2. Pull Latest Changes

Always ensure you have the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Checking Your Current Branch

It's important to know which branch you're currently working on. Use these commands:

```bash
# Show current branch name
git branch

# Show current branch with more details
git status

# Show all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a
```

The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*) when using `git branch`.

## Understanding Branches

### What is a Git Branch?

A **branch** in Git is essentially a lightweight, movable pointer to a specific commit in your project's history. Think of it as an independent line of development where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Main/Master Branch**: The primary branch of your repository (usually called `main` or `master`)
- **Feature Branch**: A separate branch created to work on a specific feature or fix
- **Branch Isolation**: Changes made on one branch don't affect other branches until you merge them
- **Branch History**: Each branch maintains its own commit history

#### Why Use Branches?

1. **Safe Development**: Work on new features without breaking the main code
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously
3. **Code Review**: Changes can be reviewed before being merged into main
4. **Experimentation**: Try different approaches without fear of losing working code
5. **Rollback**: Easy to switch back to previous versions if needed

#### Visual Example:

```
main:     A---B---C---D
                \
feature:         E---F---G
```

In this example:
- `main` branch has commits A, B, C, D
- `feature` branch was created from commit B and has additional commits E, F, G
- The branches can be merged later to combine the changes

## Creating a New Branch

### 1. Create and Switch to a New Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Alternative method (Git 2.23+)
git switch -c feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Choose a Descriptive Branch Name

Good branch names help you and your team understand what work is being done. Here are some common naming conventions:

#### Branch Naming Patterns:

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/implement-search-functionality
feature/create-dashboard-ui

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/fix-login-error
bugfix/resolve-memory-leak
bugfix/correct-typo-in-readme

# Hotfix branches (urgent fixes for production)
hotfix/fix-critical-security-issue
hotfix/resolve-payment-processing-bug

# Other common patterns
chore/update-dependencies
docs/add-api-documentation
refactor/improve-code-structure
test/add-unit-tests
```

#### Naming Best Practices:

- **Use lowercase letters** and hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces
- **Be descriptive** but concise (aim for 3-5 words)
- **Use prefixes** to categorize the type of work (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, etc.)
- **Include the issue number** if working on a specific ticket: `feature/123-add-login-form`
- **Avoid special characters** like `@`, `#`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `\`, `|`, `;`, `:`, `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`, `,`, `.`, `?`, `/`, `~`, `` ` ``, `!`

#### Examples for This Training:

```bash
# Good examples
feature/add-hello-world-script
feature/create-calculator-functions
bugfix/fix-typo-in-comments
docs/update-readme-instructions

# Avoid these
new-stuff
changes
test
my-branch
```

### 3. Verify You're on the New Branch

```bash
git branch
```

You should see your new branch highlighted with an asterisk.

## Making Code Changes

### Example: Create a Simple Python Script

Let's create a simple Python script as an example:

```bash
# Create a new Python file
touch hello_world.py
```

Add the following content to `hello_world.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
A simple hello world script for Git training.
"""

def main():
    print("Hello, Git World!")
    print("This is a training exercise.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Example: Create a JavaScript File

```bash
# Create a new JavaScript file
touch calculator.js
```

Add the following content to `calculator.js`:

```javascript
// Simple calculator for Git training
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed");
    }
    return a / b;
}

// Example usage
console.log("Calculator functions loaded!");
console.log("2 + 3 =", add(2, 3));
console.log("10 - 4 =", subtract(10, 4));
```

## Committing Changes

### 1. Check What Files Have Changed

```bash
# See which files have been modified
git status

# See the actual changes made
git diff
```

### 2. Stage Your Changes

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add hello_world.py
git add calculator.js

# Or stage all changes
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add hello world Python script and calculator JavaScript functions"
```

### 4. Verify Your Commit

```bash
# See your commit history
git log --oneline

# See the last commit details
git show
```

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

### 1. Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
# Push your branch to the remote repository
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

If this is the first time pushing this branch, Git will provide a command to set the upstream:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Verify the Push

```bash
# Check the status
git status

# See all branches including remote
git branch -a
```

## Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Navigate to GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. You should see a banner suggesting to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch
3. Click "Compare & pull request"

### 2. Fill Out the Pull Request

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Add hello world script and calculator functions")
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Reviewers**: Assign reviewers if needed
- **Labels**: Add appropriate labels

### 3. Submit the Pull Request

Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes for review.

## Useful Git Commands

### Branch Management

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name
# or
git switch branch-name

# Delete a local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

### Checking Status and History

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# See changes in working directory
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --cached
```

### Undoing Changes

```bash
# Unstage a file
git reset HEAD filename

# Discard changes to a file
git checkout -- filename

# Undo the last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo the last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Remote Operations

```bash
# Fetch latest changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Pull and merge latest changes
git pull origin main

# See remote repositories
git remote -v
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always pull before starting work**: `git pull origin main`
2. **Use descriptive branch names**: `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-header-styling`
3. **Write clear commit messages**: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
4. **Make small, focused commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
5. **Review your changes**: Use `git diff` before committing
6. **Keep your branch up to date**: Regularly pull from main and merge/rebase

## Common Workflow Summary

```bash
# 1. Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 3. Make your changes
# (edit files, add new files, etc.)

# 4. Check what you've changed
git status
git diff

# 5. Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/my-new-feature

# 7. Create pull request on GitHub
# (Navigate to GitHub and use the web interface)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you're on the wrong branch:
```bash
git checkout correct-branch-name
```

### If you have uncommitted changes and need to switch branches:
```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# Switch branches
git checkout other-branch

# Apply your stashed changes later
git stash pop
```

### If you need to update your branch with latest main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
```

Happy coding and Git learning! ðŸš€
